# Matthew Penner

Software Engineer

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with expertise in [Go](https://go.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).  I'm
driven to create scalable, performant, and redundant distributed systems; especially when Kubernetes is involved.

I graduated from high school in 2021, where I spent all my time programming and engineering robots.  Since then, I've spent
most of my time working on [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) and various other personal projects (like this site), most
notable of which are [vscode-caddyfile-support](https://github.com/matthewpi/vscode-caddyfile-support) and
[access-oidc](https://github.com/matthewpi/access-oidc).

I have a massive passion for engineering, robotics, and technology.
